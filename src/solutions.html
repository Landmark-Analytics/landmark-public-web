  average organization has a collection of XLS files that may well resemble

  layout with federating reporting and drill-through to source data. Contact us

<h2>Pre-Hire & Employee Survey Platform</h2>
<p>
  Our Test Express platform enables you to get the focus you want for a
  particular purpose whether you are assessing the biographical fit of pre-hire
  candidates or seeking ideas and issues from your current team. We offer a
  proprietary platform called Test Express which allows you to control the
  content and analytics configuration to achieve your own special purpose. Our
  platform does not offer psychometric testing, but rather a flexible approach
  to subject or theme focus to collect and compare the inputs that are most
  relevant to your application. Contact us today to learn more!
