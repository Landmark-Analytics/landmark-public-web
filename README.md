# Development
* Make sure you are doing active development in the `dev` or other branch in git!

## Visual Studio
When using Visual Studio, you can run the application without debugging several ways:
* "Debug" menu > "Start Without Debugging"
* Pressing the hollow green "run without debugging" play button

If you missed the prompt:

### When Running in VSCode
Two things will happen in VSCode when you run the application
* A little floating window should appear. You can press the stop button on that to stop the application.

  - If you press the trash can icon that will kill the process that is running the application and you will have to start it again
