    This is the page title, it's what appears in the tab of the web browser
    Note that the first part is always the same, and the 2nd part will come from
    the @ViewData["Title"] variable that can be set on each page
    *@
    <title>Landmark Analytics - @ViewData["Title"]</title>

    We first link to a "normalize.css" file hosted elsewhere on the internet
    This will make sure all web browsers render html elements consistently

            This is a special Razor tag that allows us to insert a partial page here.
            Take a look in the /Pages/Shared/_LandmakrkLogoSvg.cshtml file, it contains the SVG logo.
            It's been moved to be in a separate file just so this page isn't cluttered up with all of that stuff
            *@
            <partial name="_LandmarkLogoSvg" model='new {id="header-logo"}'>

        @*
            The links below have some special ASP.NET properties on them
            The `asp-page` property basically sets the `href` for you based on what page/view you point it to
            The `asp-active-class` will set whatever CSS class you specify on that element when you are on that page
             - If you are on the "Contact" page, the link with the matching `asp-page` set will get the `current` class added to it
        *@
